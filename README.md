# Analysis-on-Operations
Power BI Operations Dashboard – My Learning Journey  I recently worked on an Operations Data Analysis Dashboard in Power BI to analyze project performance across multiple locations in India. The dataset included over 300 projects with a total budget of more than ₹7,160 Crores, covering project statuses, timelines, and locations.
Here’s what I discovered through this dashboard:

📍 Kolkata had the highest number of projects and total budget, followed by Mumbai and Vijayawada.

⚙️ The projects were categorized as Completed, In Progress, On Hold, Not Started, and Cancelled, helping me understand overall progress and resource allocation.

📆 Trend analysis from 2016 to 2024 gave a clear view of project completions and cancellations over time
